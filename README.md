A place to understand ...how to connect, transact, and build with this language | framework | protocol.

## installation procedures
If you've just discovered `MINA` or have heard of it before, but didn't know how to get started, this is a good starting point.

There are multiple ways to get started and contribute to the network. Assuming you're a bit technical (or keen) and want to help strengthen the network, you may consider running a `block-producer` node &/or `snark-worker` node.

In terms of setup for running the above nodes, again, there is no one method. Here are few options you can look into, and based on your preference, you may choose that option.

### options
1. bare-metal: here you're either renting or purchasing a physical server
2. cloud: here you're renting a virtual computer from any of the providers (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, ...)

For the purposes of this tutorial, we are going with option **bare-metal**
